 * 697. Degree of an Array
 * =======================
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/degree-of-an-array/
 *
 * The degree of this array is defined as the maximum frequency of any one of its elements.
 * Find the smallest possible length of a (contiguous) subarray of nums, that has the same degree as nums.

        /*
        Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
        Output: 2
        Explanation:
        The input array has a degree of 2 because both elements 1 and 2 appear twice.
        Of the subarrays that have the same degree:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 1], [1, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2]
        The shortest length is 2. So return 2.
